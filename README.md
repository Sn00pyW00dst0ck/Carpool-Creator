# Carpool-Creator

A basic python application created to solve the issue of assinging drivers and riders when organizing carpooling large groups. Riders will attempt to be matched according to geological closeness based on addresses first, before being matched randomly.

_Note: In this readme all python commands use python3 as this project was developed in a Linux environment. This project should execute in other operating systems provided the proper keyword for running python is used._

## To Use
Create a csv file with columns named 'Driver', 'Capacity' and 'Rider'. Fill the spreadsheet with the names of the drivers and how many riders they can carry. Also include the name of every rider and their address. 

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install program dependencies.

Then, run the command `python3 src/main.py <input_csv_file_path> <output_csv_file_path>` from within the root directory of the project. 

The script will pair up riders and then write the result to the specified output csv file. The output csv file will have driver's names as columns and the entries below will be the people riding with that driver. 

## To Setup For Development
Begin by cloning this repository using `git clone https://github.com/Sn00pyW00dst0ck/Carpool-Creator.git`. 

The `src` directory contains the project's main executable code, and the `test` directory contains all unit tests. 

### Running Unit Tests
To run unit tests, execute the command `python3 -m unittest` from within the terminal of the root directory of the project. 

Mock data is provided in the `mock` directory and was in part generated by [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/)
